            Plate Tracker is a React-Native mobile application built around the
            OpenALPR library (Automatic License Plate Recognition). It allows
            users to scan vehicle license plates and check them against our
            database of over 12000 stolen vehicles. Users can register their
            stolen vehicles in the app and receive a notification if their
            license plate is scanned.

            I was inspired to build this app when my own motorcyle was stolen. I
            searched the internet for online communities that could support me
            in recovering my vehicle. I found many Facebook pages and bulletin
            boards fractured across the internet where people were posting their
            stolen vehicles and reporting suspicious vehicles but nowhere that
            all the information was shared. There are over 750,000 vehicles
            stolen in the US every year. Until now there was no central resource
            for people to share stolen vehicle information.

            Plate Tracker allows users to log in and create a profile. Users can
            add a vehicle to their profile and set whether or not they'd like to
            receive notifications about stolen vehicles in their area. They can
            create public posts about their vehicles or suspicious vehicles an
            they can share tips about vehicle theft prevention and recovery.
